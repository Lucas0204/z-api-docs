### Conceituação

Now with Z-API you can make calls to any number, at the moment it is not possible to send an audio during the call. This feature we call "draw attention", you know, remember the poke on facebook?

With this API you can tap and wait up to 15 seconds and hang up.

With Incoming Message webhooks, you can watch notifications and know if the person has answered or rejected the call.

:::caution Sobre chamadas

Calls use the same communication channel as messages, so the queue is paused so that another message is not sent at the same time as you are calling someone.
