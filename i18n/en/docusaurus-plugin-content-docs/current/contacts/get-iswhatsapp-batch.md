## Concept

Unlike the previous method that individually validates whether a number has WhatsApp through a GET request, this API provides batch verification.

:::caution Attention
Batch Validation Limit: The maximum number of batch validations per request is 50,000 numbers.
:::

:::important Important
This method remains the ideal choice when you need to check if a number has WhatsApp, especially useful for form validation. However, it is crucial to note that it is not recommended to use this API to verify the existence of the number before sending a message. The Z-API automatically performs this validation with every message sent, and duplicate use of this method can lead to issues.
