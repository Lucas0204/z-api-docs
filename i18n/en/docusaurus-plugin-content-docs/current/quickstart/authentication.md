## What is it and what is its purpose?


It’s not difficult to imagine that to have communication with APIs we must establish a protocol of security between both parties. What we mean is that for every interaction with Z-API and your APP, you will need to an authentication by an ID or a token.

## How do I get my id and token? 

Right after you create your account on Z-API you will need to create an instance which will contain an ID and a token to be able to identify yourself. This information will be responsible for guaranteeing the security of your communication between your application and ours. To be able to visualize your instance’s ID and your token all that is necessary is to access the admins panel and click on edit. There you will find all of the data pertaining to your instance. As a reminder, remember that you can have various instances however each one of them will have their ID and token.
