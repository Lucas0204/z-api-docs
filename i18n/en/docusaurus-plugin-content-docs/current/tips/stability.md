---

## Introduction 

For quality of service we have a few tips that could help out a lot with stability and the quality of your connection with Z-API.


## Dedicated device 

We know that it’s not always possible however, try to avoid using the device for other activities to ensure stability and quality of Z-API services. A good tip is to use Android emulators. For more information on this topic search for emulators in this same section.


## Device always connected 



For proper functioning of Z-API it needs to have the device always connected to the internet. Just like on WhatsApp web if the device loses connection, our service will also stop working. Hence why it is very important for the device to always be connected.


## Good internet connection  

Keep your phone connected to a wifi with good connection speeds and avoid using your cellphone data. The speed of your internet directly impacts the quality of exchange of information between your phone and Z-API.

## WhatsApp always open

Keeping the WhatsApp app always open helps maintain connection between our service and your phone. Just like WhatsApp web needs to communicate with your phone, when you lock your phone WhatsApp can stop running in the background which might cause loss of internet connection. This will cause unavailability of our service. Finally, if you can we recommend you to download  the app “Keep Phone On” it will help keep your phone always on.
